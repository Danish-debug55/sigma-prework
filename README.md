This is a simple text based slot machine game written in Python.

The player starts with a fixed amount of money based of what they want to input and plays up to three rounds of a slot machine.
In each round, the player places a bet and the program randomly generates three symbols.

If all three symbols match, the player wins a large payout

If two symbols match, the player wins a smaller payout

If no symbols match, the player loses the bet

The game ends after three rounds or earlier if the player runs out of money.
At the end, the program shows the player’s final balance and total winnings or losses.
